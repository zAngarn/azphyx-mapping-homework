### Dorchadas (Visuals and Movement)
I read Shikkoku no Sharnoth just because of this map.

- 00:00:00 - 00:07:127: There are two main parts here connected by a pattern in between. The movement and visuals focus on creating curves during these two main parts, where spacing and density vary according to the intensity of the song.
    - ![[{DC8A6F1D-CFC4-43B4-9D1F-149A183F209D}.png]]
    - Example of a main part here ![[{2442DE73-1C8C-44C0-B6A4-58A86679C3DD}.png]]
    - In this part of the pattern, we see a relationship of opposing curves generated by the blue 1-6 and the lime 1-4. The curve highlighted with green lines accelerates while the following curve slows down. The blue 1-6 is preceded by a curve that connects at its tail, but this one has constant velocity. Therefore, we end up with a movement consisting of the following (in order):
        - v_1 = constant, a=0
        - v_2 = constant > v_1, a=0
        - v_3 = f(a), a>0
        - v_4 = f(a), a<0
    - Visually, the part behaves this way: ![[{12518183-D42A-4D68-AB57-D267BE9E185B}.png]]
    - In blue slider composition 1, two curves can be distinguished: the first curve (head-peak) is a derivation of the start of the following yellow slider 1, thus they are related; the second curve (peak-end) forms an opposing curve relationship with respect to the first curve of yellow slider composition 1. The axis that invites the filling of this first slider is the one where the entire pattern develops ![[{0EAEEF37-FCEE-4537-BCC2-946D87373931}.png]]
    - Yellow slider composition 1 consists of a wave and a curve joined together. The wave acts as a link for the reasons mentioned above with blue slider composition 1, and the incomplete curve also relates the next two sliders in the following way. The axes generated by the wave and the curve are all interrelated. The angle between axes is the same as the one between blue slider 2 and yellow slider 2. Almost all generated blankets are complete in one way or another ![[{E193C7AA-1C89-4D77-83FE-711D45941333}.png]]
    - Blue slider 2 connects with yellow slider 1 and they generate a large circle which is filled by the passage of yellow slider 2. It is also worth noting that the path line generated is a curve representing uniformly accelerated circular motion.
    - Yellow slider 2 serves as the closure of the pattern and connects everything that remained open previously, making the entire pattern balanced.
    - The pattern acting as a link is somewhat simpler, but that doesn't make it worse. It consists of 3 curves related to each other through opposing curves and shared visual spacing, generating a 1-2-3 connected via a triple. The triangle helps reinforce the relationship between the first and last curves. ![[{0A7606AC-E719-49C9-952B-A4EFB64194DE}.png]]
    - The next pattern shares the characteristics of the first one but with some rotations so it isn't a copy-paste. Similarly, it behaves visually like this and similar relationships to those described above are observed. This is why we won't go into depth with each of the "sliders" and their movement: ![[{F5090F2C-3163-430B-8CDC-DEF4D8743F34} 1.png]]
- 00:07:127 - 00:16:063: The sliders with reverse arrows vary in length following a long-short-long progression (this correlates with the pitch of the bass, but that's not what interests us right now). The bass sounds occurring every 6 divisions in 1/4 snap use these sliders, which are related simply by sharing sound and curve shape.
    - The connection slider between sections (yellow 1 on the left) is used for the first reverse, forming a 1-2-3 with yellow circle 2 on the right with curve relationships ![[{02893E5-FE63-4AC3-8C32-480F68CD33B2}.png]]
    - Similarly, the same type of relationships can be affirmed between the 2 reverses. It is observed how the relationship between them consists of alternating curves of different radii in the following way, generating an ascending alternating progression of radii: ![[{03097CC7-0CEF-4443-AC3A-0EFABE93372E}.png]]
    - This is simply a progression of ascending radii linked through the center triangle and the visual spacing in that area ![[Pasted image 20260131223612.png]]
    - The next two reverses and the slider connecting to the next part are related through 3 different elements: 
        - First: The axes defined by the head and slider end of each are always perpendicular to one another.
        - Second: There is a descending curve relationship that continues until the blue 1 with a reverse on the far left.
        - Third: From the intersection point of the axes between sliders, if we define the distance from the intersection point to the slider head (or tail, depending on what we are looking at), we see a constant relationship of proportionality between them. The image makes it easier to understand ![[{0DC8545B-DA67-4F2B-8CD1-122D83622064}.png]]
    - Afterwards, the curve generated by the next three sliders (purple line) connects with the following reverse through a pure relationship of descending radii curves. It's worth mentioning that throughout this section, a global progression of radii is occurring. We will touch on this later because it is quite curious.
    - The next two reverses also share a relationship through visual spacing and radii progression. What was a triangle in the first part of this section is here a curve that crosses the entire screen from blue 1 on the right to blue on the left, with a progression of radii ![[{2D878BC4-F41E-4ECC-8FEC-CFD28C1B7ABE}.png]]
    - Here we can see an alternating ascending relationship of radii again, but slightly different. Other relationships between objects occur, such as those provided by visual spacing ![[{90CBED98-2F2E-49BE-9E51-18922D6B7690}.png]]
    - To close this section, let's look at what is happening with the radii. In the song, it could be argued that the protagonist is the accordion melody. The radii vary according to its pitch. If you have the map at hand, I strongly recommend you look at this part with this in mind, because rrtyui is implicitly putting the pitch on the screen.
- 00:16:063 - 00:31:382: A more relaxed part where the accordion does not appear. The relationships in this part are somewhat simpler.
    - This is a basic 1-2-3 where blue 1 opens, 2 and 3 connect, and yellow 1 closes. However, the most relevant thing here is that the closing object breaks the axis of the previous ones in the strongest way possible: perpendicularly ![[{4397638E-4985-4F20-A5EF-EE53AAA8850C}.png]]
    - Entering this pattern from the purple arrow, we see that the axis of this entire section is parallel to the previous yellow wave, achieving a relationship between these points. Blue 1 and 3 are red-point sliders and share visual spacing, creating a relationship between them, in addition to the 1-2-3 they form with the 2 overlapping the slider end of blue 1. One could also argue the existence of a 1-2-3 between the previous yellow wave, the two circles to the left of blue 1, and blue 1 itself through parallel axes, as both sliders are related by that mechanism and the circles connect with the 3 of the 1-2-3 (acting as the 2) ![[{BF16F343-000A-4426-9DBB-B0FD3D570332}.png]]
    - I won't continue looking pattern by pattern, but essentially this part is summarized by relationships through similar curves, axes, and spacing, which results in a varied movement that reflects the creator's intention at all times.
- 00:31:382 - 00:50:212: This section is practically identical to the previous one, except that every 6 measures there is a very striking sound which rrtyui decides to highlight using sliders very different from what we've seen before. I won't delve too deeply into this part either since it's not very different from the previous one, except they are 1-2-3s working around the focal points mentioned earlier that occur every 6 measures.
    - This "super slider" is the center of attention for everything coming and everything before it. We could argue there is a 1-2-3 applied at a much larger level in the map where, between focal sliders, all objects work to relate them. This is why we can say that in the global 1-2-3 of the section, the elements between focal sliders would be our "2" ![[{8DABF4E7-E452-4B47-847C-F4F1DABBB622}.png]]
- 00:54:212 - 01:10:212: Just like in the first section of the map, there are two identical parts within this section of the song where patterns repeat. We will only look at one for obvious reasons.
    - An important note: the curvature radius of all sliders in this section is very similar if not identical (similar to the SV), except for two sliders that appear a bit later. With this technique, he ensures that any slider that is even slightly different stands out immediately without needing to do what he did in the previous section.
    - The first pattern opens with the slider snapped to 1/3 blue on the far left, which leads to the pair of identical sliders generating an axis of symmetry upon which the movement will flow. The pair is related through identical curves, an axis of symmetry, and a 1-2-3 with blue circles 3 and 4. The movement in this part is "snap" based, which will contrast with the next part which is "flow" based ![[{EDBBD237-D675-4B19-AC45-5DE56B78CDF3}.png]]
    - Afterwards, the first yellow slider of the next pattern is located within the axis of movement of the previous pattern, connecting it so it feels more natural, in addition to an opposing curve relationship. The pattern closes with the yellow 1 snapped to 1/3 to highlight the bottom right corner, as that is where the movement of the 4 previous sliders naturally leads. A flow movement is observed that contrasts with the previous part as we see an alternation between flow and snap ![[{D6EF8B2D-1BF8-4AF2-8671-8CB97912DA64}.png]]
    - The same axis we saw earlier pointing down now reappears pointing up through the slider-circle duo. The previous slider attaches to this pattern again through the blanket of yellow 2 at the bottom. Once again, a movement much more "snap" and similar to the other snap pattern appears to contrast with the previous one ![[{B091F494-0B3C-4E90-8E9D-F2166BC5130D}.png]]
    - Here a triangle of sliders appears around a central point where the next slider ends; this one stands out significantly because it is unlike the rest and is snapped to 1/2. It connects with the previous part through visual spacing, curve relationship, and the overlap appearing between yellow 3, yellow 5, and blue 1, which the important slider later leans on. Additionally, a much more curved flow reappears, contrasting with the previous snap ![[{15BD0F4B-8E9B-493A-A1D4-0EC6322E9184}.png]]
    - This pattern now plays with a progression of slider lengths that opens up more and more until ending in a wave. The same relationships we've discussed before are observed. Again, a more snap-based movement prepares us for the next pattern ![[{4E3242F6-DA11-4CAD-AC36-91196615B23F}.png]]
    - This flow pattern closes the first subsection of the map. This pattern is connected to the previous one through the overlap of blue 4 with the slider end of the previous yellow 4, in addition to the curve relationship they form ![[{C446FCD3-6C60-45F3-B22F-59EFEA95BDFE}.png]]
- 01:10:212 - end: To avoid repeating everything I've seen, the relationships until the end of the map are mostly a mix of what we've seen before. For this part, I will simply add images of some patterns I like or that caught my attention.
    - The blue 1-2 goes hard as hell, breaking the movement to introduce a brief snap moment ![[{AC850A28-FAEC-4278-8ADC-50F26DA8F06E}.png]]
    - How everything is connected in this one is insane ![[{3253C404-6016-4AB5-AE47-BEA344054885}.png]]
    - The movement goes hard as hell here ![[{E73BBC3E-5227-44C5-85F6-BBC0E42A6CA8}.png]]
    - Relationships of alternating decreasing radii ![[{28EE3879-B0F3-4BDD-9D93-A4BEC9B64E1B}.png]]
    - The map's ending is beautiful ![[Pasted image 20260201132410.png]]

### Futuristic Imagination (Curve Relationships and Structure)
Continuing with the rrtyui grind. Holy shit, I should have started with this one and not Dorchadas.

- I mainly observe three mechanisms of curve relationships: curve opposition, repetition, and radii progressions. 
- Abrupt changes in radii create emphasis; one must be careful not to emphasize things unintentionally:
    - For example, if I am coming from a progression where the radius is decreasing, and I want to break this because there is a new phrase or whatever, the best way would be with an abrupt change—meaning my next slider should have a very large radius.
    - In this example, sliders 4 and 5 have the most relevance due to their sudden change. Analytically we could say that if $$\left|\frac{dS(t_2)}{dt}\right|>\left|\frac{dS(t_1)}{dt}\right|$$ then for the three objects within those two intervals $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively, the most important object would be the third one; in the opposite case, it would be the second ![[Pasted image 20260201134557.png]]
- Slider positioning depends a bit on the situation and the axis you are working on. There isn't a strictly defined rule for these cases. Combining this with 1-2-3s and varying the movement is how visually pleasing (and playable!) things arise. See the Dorchadas section to better understand how curve relationships apply to visuals and movement.
- The aforementioned mechanisms can be combined with rotations, SV, space (whatever you can think of) to generate more variations. Curve relationships are just another mechanism to keep in mind.
- As for the map's structure, it's simply well-made:
    - 7 distinct sections can be observed within the map ![[{4739286B-1D5C-4145-ABBA-3986C0D99F1E}.png]]
    - Each section offers something different; there is an intensity associated with each that corresponds to the song to give it a specific meaning.
        - Section 1 is calmer, without much movement.
            - In terms of microstructure, nothing remarkable. Low density with the occasional focal point.
        - Section 2 starts the drums with higher intensity; therefore, to generate contrast, the map increases movement and introduces new rhythms.
            - We start to see more things here: ![[{9A89BECA-244B-4347-85C7-77204E819FBC}.png]]
            - At all times, it tries to move across the entire playfield. If you look every 2 measures, you can see objects spread across the whole playfield with relationships between all of them.
        - Section 3, having such a characteristic rhythm, achieves greater contrast compared to the rest.
            - Thanks to this, this part has a very marked structure consisting of curve patterns related by successive rotations and linear jumps between patterns to connect them. It only breaks this dynamic at the end to connect with the next section.
        - Section 4 is a derivative of Section 3 but with a melody (thanks to the drums). By following the drums, it generates contrast and keeps it well-defined.
            - Its structure, being derived from the previous one, consists again of a melody that repeats four times, introducing small variations in rhythms so it doesn't feel repetitive. Movement is similar to Section 2 (2 measures / playfield).
        - Sections 5 and 6 are almost identical except for the end of Section 6. Being both part of the kiai, they are naturally similar in movement and patterns (obviously, the most intense part of the map by nature).
            - Here, I'd like to recall how in Section 2, it took 2 measures to cover the playfield. In these sections, it covers the playfield in 1 measure, meaning the movement is effectively doubled. This is achieved through higher SV and more objects.
        - Section 7 serves as the final touch to the map. Since the song varies here again, following the violin generates contrast with the previous parts. It's worth noting the beginning of this section acts as a connection to Section 6, which is why it's also slightly different.
            - Movement decreases slightly and, following the drums with streams, it closes the map.

### Mellow Melody (Slider Design, Intensity Management, Pattern Transitions)
- In the slider design department, we have the following observations:
    - Almost the entire map is composed of simple curves; other sliders like spirals or waves only appear occasionally. This mechanic is only seen in the calm part of the map.
    - Once we reach the kiai, there is a wider variety of sliders, but the repertoire remains limited, giving the map coherence.
    - Regarding large sliders, although they look very different from other objects, they are actually compositions of curves we've seen before, related through the mechanisms discussed earlier. If we separated them, we would have a perfectly functional pattern. This is an exercise we leave to the reader to try on their own.
- Regarding intensity management:
    - In this map, it's done mainly through movement. We see relatively calm movement in the first section, and upon entering the second calm section, he stops using reverse arrows on sliders and simply follows the movement. We could say the first section alternates its movement thanks to reverses and the second is more constant. Later, in the third part (kiai), movement is at its peak. It also uses higher SV and is generally denser.
- Regarding transitions between patterns:
    - Nothing we haven't touched upon before. It's mainly based on making the "transition" object (I highly recommend viewing this analysis through the 1-2-3 lens) maintain a relationship with everything prior so it doesn't feel disconnected. This can be seen as boxes overlapping at some point, with that shared point being the transition object. Generally, when you look at this map (and any map considered good), there are no stray objects; a justification for their placement can always be found.

### Ame to Asphalt (Rhythms, Intensity Management, Contrasts)
The three characteristics to analyze are strongly linked, as they all depend on each other.
- Movement throughout the map could be described as semi-constant; it's not the highlight. So, how does he achieve contrast and different intensities between sections? The answer is through different rhythms and object densities.
- The parts of the song that are calmer are reflected in the map through undermapping and low densities. Conversely, for more intense parts, contrast is achieved through overmapping and creating rhythms distinct from everything else.
